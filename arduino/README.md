A minimal, but very functional, battleship 'AI' that runs on arduino. Should compile and run just fine.
```
Sketch uses 6914 bytes (21%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes.
Global variables use 390 bytes (19%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1658 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes.
```
## Notes
This is test code, so its not perfect, keep that in mind.

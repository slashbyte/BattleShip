# Battleship Game Engine
What lives here, is a pretty awesome battleship game engine. But wait theres more, there are two engines that play battleship!

Codename **Barracuda** is an engine that uses "superpositions" to calculate the best possible move.

Codename **The Drunk Capitan** randomly picks a move and sticks to it, even though it only looked good three beers ago.

# Uboard (test program)
This program allows you to pin engines against each other, run tests, and other things. Since theres no standard battleship engine protocol, I winged it.

Uboard, Battleship engine benchmark program
-------------------------------------------
Usage: Uboard.exe -a engineone.exe -n 100 [-f -v]
       Uboard.exe -a engineone.exe -n 1 -s [-v]
       Uboard.exe -a engineone.exe -b enginetwo.exe -n 100 -m [-v]
       Uboard.exe -a engineone.exe -b enginetwo.exe -n 1 -s [-v]
       Uboard.exe -a engineone.exe -d [-v]
```

### Usage:
```
Uboard.exe -a engineone.exe -n 100 [-f -v]
```
This runs a "move analysis" on the engine.

* [-a] tells 'Uboard' what engine your running.
* [-f] Displays a move frequency list.
* [-n] Specifies the number of random games to be played.
* [-v] Suppresses some output.

Sample Output

Uboard.exe -a engineone.exe -b enginetwo.exe -n 1 -s [-v]
```
This runs a random test case on the engines, allowing you to see how well each engine preformed on the same game, side by side.

* [-a] tells 'Uboard' what engine your running.
* [-b] tells 'Uboard' what engine your running.
* [-s] use the same random test boards for the engine.
* [-n] Specifies the number of random games to be played.
* [-v] Suppresses some output.
